Q: Julieâ€™s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard? Answer Choices: (a) 30 feet (b) 20 feet (c) 10 feet (d) 50 feet (e) 60 feet
A: Let's think step by step. We know that the yard is rectangular, so it has four sides. We also know that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. We can set up the equation: 3,000 = 100x x = 30 So, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet. The answer is (a). 

Q: In a survey of students, each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best. If each song was selected 5 times, how many students were surveyed? Answer Choices: (a) 96 (b) 48 (c) 32 (d) 25 (e) 18
A: Let's think step by step. There are 10 songs, and each song is selected 5 times. That means that there are 50 selections in total. Each student makes 2 selections, so there must be 25 students. The answer is (d). 

Q: Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75". John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75". How much money did John have ? Answer Choices: (a) 22 (b) 60 (c) 28 (d) 26 (e) 18
A: Let's think step by step. If Mark has Rs.75, then John has Rs.75 as well. If Mark gives John half his money, then Mark will have Rs.37.50 and John will have Rs.112.50. However, this isn't one of the answer choices. If Mark gives John one third of his money, then Mark will have Rs.50 and John will have Rs.100. This is one of the answer choices, so John must have had Rs.100 to begin with. The answer is (d).

Q: A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain? Answer Choices: (a) 80 kmph (b) 50 kmph (c) 120 kmph (d) 70 kmph (e) 80 kmph
A: Let's think step by step. The car is currently travelling at 60 km/hr. In order to travel the same distance in 10 hours, the car would need to travel at 6 times the speed, or 360 km/hr. Therefore, the car would need to gain 300 km/hr. The answer is (c).
