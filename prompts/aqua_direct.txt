Q: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is?
Hint: The answer is one of {50, 45, 65, 78, 64}
A: If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. So the new mean would be 50. The answer is 50.

Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.
Hint: The answer is one of {1/2, 3/2, 5/2, 4/2, 7/2}
A: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2. The answer is 3/2.

Q: A person is traveling at 20 km/hr and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?

Hint: The answer is one of {1156, 1392, 1480, 1562, 1788}
A: There are 9 one-digit numbers from 1 to 9. There are 90 two-digit numbers from 10 to 99. There are 401 three-digit numbers from 100 to 500. 9 + 90(2) + 401(3) = 1392. The answer is 1392.
