Problem:
Subproblem 0: What is the net charge of arginine in a solution of $\mathrm{pH} 1.0$?
Please format your answer as +n or -n.
Solution:
The answer is +2.

Problem:
Subproblem 0: Let $z = 1 + \sqrt{3} i$. Find $a, b$ that satisfy the equation
$z^4 = a + bi$. Express your answer as the ordered pair $(a,b)$.
Solution:
$z^{4}$ has argument $4 \pi / 3$ and radius 16 , so itâ€™s equal to $-8-8 \sqrt{3} i$.
Thus $a = -8, b = -8\sqrt 3$, and our answer is $\boxed{(-8, -8\sqrt{3})}$.
The answer is (-8, -8\sqrt{3}).

Problem:
Preamble: For each Laplace Transform \(Y(s)\), find the function \(y(t)\):
Subproblem 0:
\[Y(s)=\boxed{\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)}}\]
Solution:
We can simplify with partial fractions:
\[Y(s)=\\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)}=\\frac{C}{s+a}+\\frac{D}{s+b}\]\nfind the constants
\(C\) and \(D\) by setting \(s=-a\) and \(s=-b\)
\[
  \begin{aligned}
  \frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)} &=\\frac{C}{s+a}+\\frac{D}{s+b} \\\\
  1 &=C(s+b)+D(s+a) \\
  C &=\\frac{1}{b-a} \\
  D &=\\frac{1}{a-b}
  \end{aligned}
\]
therefore
\[\nY(s)=\frac{1}{b-a} \frac{1}{s+a}-\frac{1}{b-a} \frac{1}{s+b}
\]
By looking up the inverse Laplace Transform of \(\frac{1}{s+b}\), we find the total
solution \(y(t)\)
\[
y(t)=\boxed{\frac{1}{b-a}\left(e^{-a t}-e^{-b t}\right)}
\].
The answer is \[\frac{1}{b-a}\left(e^{-a t}-e^{-b t}\right)\].

Problem:
Preamble: The following subproblems refer to the differential equation
$\ddot{x}+b \dot{x}+x=0$.
Subproblem 0: What is the characteristic polynomial $p(s)$ of
$\ddot{x}+b \dot{x}+x=0$?
Solution:
The characteristic polynomial is $p(s)=\\boxed{s^{2}+b s+1}$.
The answer is $s^{2}+b s+1$.
